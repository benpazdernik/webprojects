The co-creators of Pixel Jar, Brandon and Jeff, met working at another web development firm in 2001. Pixel Jar started in 2004 with the goal to provide solid web solutions for small to medium businesses. In 2007 we worked on our first WordPress project and loved it so much that by 2009, our business model was solely WordPress projects. We are very active in the WordPress community, regularly attending and presenting at our local WordPress Meetup, attending regional WordCamps and hosting the annual WordCamp Orange County.</dd>
